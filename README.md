# Credit-Underwriting-Software
	Elevate Export Finance lends to foreign buyers of Canadian manufactured goods with an Export Development Canada guarantee. Through this project we will consider the scoring system and integrate it into a custom application that allows us to determine credit worthiness based on pre-determined financial criteria.

Scoring system details
	The scoring is based on achievement of five financial ratios which we get from their financial statements. The scoring would be an equal weighting for these (or different weightings that I can find out for you). If all criteria is met then it could be a green. If 75% met it could be yellow and if below 75% if could be red. Something like that. But would nice to for the application to provide a score and point out where the company is not meeting the standards.

What type of application would you need?
	This could be either a desktop application or a cloud based application.

Who would be the end user?
	The Credit department of our company would be the end user.

A more descriptive list of mandatory requirements
The mandatory requires are as follows:

*DEFINITIONS:
 
	Operating Profit = operating revenues - costs of goods sold - operating expenses (which include depreciation & amortization expense but exclude extraordinary items and discontinued operations)
 
	Cash From Operations = net income + depreciation & amortization + period changes in non-cash working capital items
 
	EBITDA = net income + interest + taxes + depreciation & amortization
 
	Tangible Net Worth = total assets - total liabilities - intangible assets
 
	Debt Service Coverage = ___________EBITDA___________
                                             current period principal & interest
                                          
	Cash Flow Leverage = ___ debt ___
                                              EBITDA
 
	Financial Leverage = total liabilities (including new debt)
                                                 Tangible Net Worth.
 
 
 
What are the risks of incorrect score prediction/ software failure?
	The risks would be that we inaccurately score potential borrowers which could negatively affect our underwriting process.
